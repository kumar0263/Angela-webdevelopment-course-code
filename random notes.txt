Day 1-> HOw internet works
        and submarinecablemap.com website to see underwater cable connections
        Client -> ISP -> DNS 
        How Do websites works
        when we request the server it will send the data back in the form of html,Css and javascript files and we need to use a browser like chrome or someother 
        thing that will combine all these files and shows us the actual website
        HTML -> content
        CSS -> Styling
        JS -> Functionality
        

Day 2 -> Made a small html website 
        Learning about file paths 

Day 3 -> relative file path and absolute file path
        relative file path -> we use special characters 
                                1. two double dots(indicates moving up a level in file path and look for the thing)[../]
                                2. single dot(indicates us to stay in the current directory and look for the thing)[./]
                                
        Building multi-page websites
                we use anchor tag and give relative path of the other html page <a href="relative xpath">another page</a>

        Html boiler plate code
                <!DOCTYPE html> -> tells the browser that the html code is written in which version in our case it's html 5
                <html lang="en"> </html> => root of the document 
                <head> </head> -> imp info about our website this info is not shown to user \
                <meta charset = "UTF-8"> -> will be present in the head tag 
                <meta name="viewport" content"width=device-width", initial-scale=1.0">
                <title> </title> -> name of the website inside the head tag
                <body> </body> -> all the content will be present

Day 4 ->
